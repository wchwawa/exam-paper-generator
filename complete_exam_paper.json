      "explanation": "HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage by using elements and tags. The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can respond to them. In web development, events are often triggered by user actions such as clicking, typing, or moving the mouse. The DOM allows developers to attach event listeners to HTML elements, enabling interactive and dynamic web pages.",

      "explanation": "Debugging is crucial in JavaScript development as it helps identify and fix errors in the code, ensuring that the application functions as intended. Effective debugging can prevent runtime errors and improve the user experience by providing a smooth and error-free interaction. Pre-validation, on the other hand, enhances data integrity by ensuring that user inputs meet the required criteria before being processed by the server. This reduces the risk of errors and security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Together, debugging and pre-validation contribute to the overall quality and reliability of web applications by ensuring that they are robust, secure, and user-friendly.",
